# Crystals Collector


The Crystals Collector game opens up in a new tab. The player wins the game by matching the computer generated random number. The player losses if he/she goes past the computer generated random number. The player pays the game by clicking four crystal diamonds.


In the game, the computer picks a random number between 19 and 120 which is used as the target the player should match. The user is then given four crystals that also have random number attributes between 1 and 12. The user only knows the random number assigned to the crystal when he/she clicks on the crystal. The crystal random number is accumulated to a score each time the user clicks it. If the score matches the target number, then the player wins the game. If the score exceeds the target then the player has lost the game. The game restarts after 5 seconds and the player can start playing the game again.


## Setup

This game was developed using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript and JQuery.


## Play

The game can be accessed [Heroku](https://serene-forest-57972.herokuapp.com) on the Portfolio link.


## Envisaged Game Improvements

I would want to add an option for the player to chhose complexity level. With this, I would want the clicked crystal to change to another random number between 1 and 12. This will ensure the random number added to the score will always be changing and the user will not know which crystal to keep clicking inorder to win the game.
